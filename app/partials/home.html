            <h1>Clara Zhang</h1>
            Clara Zhang, a native of China, with her passion and persistence, has made her dream come true as an international concert pianist
            and a well-respected piano teacher in New York City. Born in HeBei, China in the early 80's, Zhang, among many children of her generation,
            started her lifelong training in music from a young age. On her third birthday her grandmother gave her an electronic keyboard. On that day,
            her future became clear - having no brothers or sisters to share it with, she went to a tree in the yard and promised to herself and the
            tree that one day she will move to New York City, America and be the greatest pianist ever!&nbsp;<a href="index.html#/bio">More...</a>
