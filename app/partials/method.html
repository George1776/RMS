<p>For beginner students, I like to use the faber &amp; faber piano adventures book series to get students started. If you are under the age of 3, I might also include the Alfred little Mozart series. I also use the A dozen a day for technique training for each student until you are able to play scales/Arpeggios or other finger exercised composed by Czerny, Hanon or other notable composers.</p>
